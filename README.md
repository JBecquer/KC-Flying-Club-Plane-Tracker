# KC-Flying-Club-Plane-Tracker

Provide a previous month map of where the FCKC airplanes travelled to.


- Create a local-area map (KC metro) with airplane ground track overlay
- Create a US area map with airplane ground track overlay
	- Each aircraft will have it's own color code
	- Short term goal I am thinking about a simple .jpg-type file. Start simple.
  
- Create a section for aircraft stats:
	- Miles flown in the previous month
	- Max time aloft
	- Max airspeed
	- Number of unique airports visited
	- List of all airports visited
  
- Create an archive that has previous months data
	- Organized by year & month
	
	---
	
- Stretch goals:
	- Be able to select which aircraft are shown on the map
	- Have the map auto-zoom to fit the activity area
	- Zoom in/out
	- google maps integration?
